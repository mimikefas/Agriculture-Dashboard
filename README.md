# Agriculture-Dashboard
An Agricultural Sector wants to get insights and recommendations to improve their crop products and by this analysis it will be able to make decisions on what is economically best for the sector and productive revenue after every harvest.It includes inputs such as soil type, pesticide used, water usage,fertilizer used, farm area and season, the data was collected from different sources making it valuable for agricultural research, analysis and decision making. 
# Features:
- Season: Zaid, Kharif, Rabi 
- Soil type: Clay, Loamy, Peaty, Silty and Sandy
- fertilizer usage
- Water
- Yield
- Farm Area
- Pesticide
- crop type: tomato, Barley, Maize, Cotton, Rice, Potato, wheat, Sugarcane, Soybean and carrot
- Irrigation type: Drip, Flood, Manual, Sprinkler and rain-fed.
# Use cases:
- Identifying optimal crop type for specific season
- Impact of soil type for sustainable farming
- Analysing irrigation type for minimal wastageand water usage efficiency
- Analysing pesticide and fertilizer for soil health and environmental impact.
- This dataset was gotten from kaggle and it consist of 50 rows and 10 columns.
I used power BI to visualize and analyse the dataset to be able to get a clear insight where the sector is lacking. In the process of analysing and visualization i uploaded the dataset on Power BI through csv format with clear columns and rows to assist in understanding the variable.
There was no missing values and blank spaces meaning the data is clean and fit for visualization and analysis.
# Key Questions:
-	How soil type and season affects production.
-	What is the best irrigation type for a soil type.
- Best farming season with given inputs like fertilizer, pesticides, water and irrigation type.
-	 What crop type produced more 
-	How farming inputs affects crop type and total produced.
-	What farm area produce more.
-	Best irrigation type for a season.
# Findings:
-	Loamy soil produced more during the Zaid season.
-	Cotton consumed more farm area and produced less.
-	Tomato produced more at the end of the final production.
-	There is an insignificant relationship between irrigation type and soil type.
-	Inputs are not sufficiently put to use.
-	Underutilization of farm area.
-	Inefficient yield despite high input.
-	Silty soil type is best for flood and rain fed irrigation type.
-	Sandy soil type is best for drip irrigation.
-	Loamy soil type is best use for manual irrigation type.
-	Clay soil type is best for sprinkler irrigation type.
# Problems:
-	Inefficient input usage: over use of resources without corresponding yield.
-	Underutilization of farm area: more farm area was use for less productive crop.
-	Incompatibility between irrigation methods and soil types reduced efficiency of production.
-	Over use of fertilizer could harm the soil and ecosystem.
- There is inefficient practice which is causing high cost with no corresponding increase in revenue.
# Recommendations:
- Seminars and workshops should be organized for farmers to help them have more insight on how to use and utilize farming equipments and products.
- Farmers should have planting schedules base on seasonal performance, with this they will be able to farm a crop type that have a significant relationship with a season.
- The use of drip, sprinkler and rain fed for irrigation method for water intensive crops, this helps reduce the quantity of water use on the farm area.
- Improve soil health by using organic products such as manure which is very cheap and easy to get, it will help reduce cost.
- Using soil rotation helps improves fertility of soil, erosion and optimize resource usage.
# Conclusion:
If all these are put to practice there will be productive revenue in the Agricultural sector and it will bring about an increase increase in economic growth, reduction in unemployement rate, export revenue,food security and source of raw materials.
